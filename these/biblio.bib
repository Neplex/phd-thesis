  abstract = {The design of several database query languages has been influenced by Codd's relational algebra. This paper discusses the difficulty of optimizing queries based on the relational algebra operations select, project, and join. A matrix, called a tableau, is proposed as a useful device for representing the value of a query, and optimization of queries is couched in terms of finding a minimal tableau equivalent to a given one. Functional dependencies can be used to imply additional equivalences among tableaux. Although the optimization problem is NP-complete, a polynomial time algorithm exists to optimize tableaux that correspond to an important subclass of queries.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the problem of consistency maintenance when insertions or deletions are performed on a valid database containing marked nulls. This problem comes back to light in real-world linked data or RDF databases when blank nodes are associated with null values. This paper proposes solutions for the main problems one has to face when dealing with updates and constraints, namely update determinism, minimal change and leanness of an RDF graph instance. The update semantics is formally introduced and the notion of core is used to ensure a database as small as possible (i.e.~~ the RDF graph leanness). Our algorithms allow the use of constraints such as tuple-generating dependencies, offering a way for solving many practical problems.},

  abstract = {We define the class of conjunctive queries in relational data bases, and the generalized join operator on relations. The generalized join plays an important part in answering conjunctive queries, and it can be implemented using matrix multiplication. It is shown that while answering conjunctive queries is NP complete (general queries are PSPACE complete), one can find an implementation that is within a constant of optimal. The main lemma used to show this is that each conjunctive query has a unique minimal equivalent query (much like minimal finite automata).},
