  abstract = {The design of several database query languages has been influenced by Codd's relational algebra. This paper discusses the difficulty of optimizing queries based on the relational algebra operations select, project, and join. A matrix, called a tableau, is proposed as a useful device for representing the value of a query, and optimization of queries is couched in terms of finding a minimal tableau equivalent to a given one. Functional dependencies can be used to imply additional equivalences among tableaux. Although the optimization problem is NP-complete, a polynomial time algorithm exists to optimize tableaux that correspond to an important subclass of queries.},

A basic feature of our approach is that new knowledge inputs are always assimilated. Moreover, updates are always deterministic and they preserve database consistency.We consider that update rules have higher priority than query rules, i.e., update rules may generate exceptions to query-driven derivations. We introduce a semantics framework for database update and query answering, based on the well-founded semantics. We also suggest an alternative approach based on extended logic programs and we show that our database model can be defined in terms of non-monotonic formalisms.},

The update semantics is formally introduced and the notion of core is used to ensure a database as small as possible (i.e.~~ the RDF graph leanness). Our algorithms allow the use of constraints such as tuple-generating dependencies, offering a way for solving many practical problems.},

We re-examine the notion of certainty itself, and show that it is much more varied than previously thought.

A GED is defined as a combination of a graph pattern and an attribute dependency. In a uniform format, GEDs can express graph functional dependencies with constant literals to catch inconsistencies, and keys carrying id literals to identify entities (vertices) in a graph. We revise the chase for GEDs and prove its Church-Rosser property. We characterize GED satisfiability and implication, and establish the complexity of these problems and the validation problem for GEDs, in the presence and absence of constant literals and id literals. We also develop a sound, complete and independent axiom system for finite implication of GEDs. In addition, we extend GEDs with built-in predicates or disjunctions, to strike a balance between the expressive power and complexity. We settle the complexity of the satisfiability, implication, and validation problems for these extensions.},

  abstract = {Keys for graphs aim to uniquely identify entities represented by vertices in a graph. We propose a class of keys that are recursively defined in terms of graph patterns, and are interpreted with subgraph isomorphism. Extending conventional keys for relations and XML, these keys find applications in object identification, knowledge fusion and social network reconciliation. As an application, we study the entity matching problem that, given a graph G and a set {$\Sigma$} of keys, is to find all pairs of entities (vertices) in G that are identified by keys in {$\Sigma$}. We show that the problem is intractable, and cannot be parallelized in logarithmic rounds. Nonetheless, we provide two parallel scalable algorithms for entity matching, in MapReduce and a vertex-centric asynchronous model. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithms.},

  abstract = {A promising method for efficiently querying RDF data consists of translating SPARQL queries into efficient RDBMS-style operations. However, answering SPARQL queries requires handling RDF reasoning, which must be implemented outside the relational engines that do not support it. We introduce the database (DB) fragment of RDF, going beyond the expressive power of previously studied RDF fragments. We devise novel sound and complete techniques for answering Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) queries within the DB fragment of RDF, exploring the two established approaches for handling RDF semantics, namely reformulation and saturation. In particular, we focus on handling database updates within each approach and propose a method for incrementally maintaining the saturation; updates raise specific difficulties due to the rich RDF semantics. Our techniques are designed to be deployed on top of any RDBMS(-style) engine, and we experimentally study their performance trade-offs.},

  abstract = {Incomplete data is ubiquitous: the more data we accumulate and the more widespread tools for integrating and exchanging data become, the more instances of incompleteness we have. And yet the subject is poorly handled by both practice and theory. Many queries for which students get full marks in their undergraduate courses will not work correctly in the presence of incomplete data, but these ways of evaluating queries are cast in stone -- SQL standard. We have many theoretical results on handling incomplete data but they are, by and large, about showing high complexity bounds, and thus are often dismissed by practitioners. Even worse, we have a basic theoretical notion of what it means to answer queries over incomplete data, and yet this is not at all what practical systems do. Is there a way out of this predicament? Can we have a theory of incompleteness that will appeal to theoreticians and practitioners alike, by explaining incompleteness and being at the same time implementable and useful for applications? After giving a critique of both the practice and the theory of handling incompleteness in databases, the paper outlines a possible way out of this crisis. The key idea is to combine three hitherto used approaches to incompleteness: one based on certain answers and representation systems, one based on viewing incomplete databases as logical theories, and one based on orderings expressing relative value of information.},

  abstract = {\'Etant une repr\'esentation formelle et explicite des connaissances d'un domaine, les ontologies font r\'eguli\`erement l'objet de nombreux changements et ont ainsi besoin d'\^etre constamment adapt\'ees pour notamment pouvoir \^etre r\'eutilis\'ees et r\'epondre aux nouveaux besoins. Leur r\'eutilisation peut prendre diff\'erentes formes (\'evolution, alignement, fusion, etc.), et pr\'esente plusieurs verrous scientifiques. L'un des plus importants est la pr\'eservation de la consistance de l'ontologie lors de son changement. Afin d'y r\'epondre, nous nous int\'eressons dans cette th\`ese \`a \'etudier les changements ontologiques et proposons un cadre formel capable de faire \'evoluer et de fusionner des ontologies sans affecter leur consistance. Premi\`erement, nous proposons TGGOnto (Typed Graph Grammars for Ontologies), un nouveau formalisme permettant la repr\'esentation des ontologies et leurs changements par les grammaires de graphes typ\'es. Un couplage entre ces deux formalismes est d\'efini afin de profiter des concepts des grammaires de graphes, notamment les NAC (Negative Application Conditions), pour la pr\'eservation de la consistance de l'ontologie adapt\'ee.Deuxi\`emement, nous proposons EvOGG (Evolving Ontologies with Graph Grammars), une approche d'\'evolution d'ontologies qui se base sur le formalisme GGTOnto et traite les inconsistances d'une mani\`ere a priori. Nous nous int\'eressons aux ontologies OWL et nous traitons \`a la fois : (1) l'enrichissement d'ontologies en \'etudiant leur niveau structurel et (2) le peuplement d'ontologies en \'etudiant les changements qui affectent les individus et leurs assertions. L'approche EvOGG d\'efinit des changements ontologiques de diff\'erents types (\'el\'ementaires, compos\'ees et complexes) et assure leur impl\'ementation par l'approche alg\'ebrique de transformation de graphes, SPO (Simple PushOut). Troisi\`emement, nous proposons GROM (Graph Rewriting for Ontology Merging), une approche de fusion d'ontologies capable d'\'eviter les redondances de donn\'ees et de diminuer les conflits dans le r\'esultat de fusion. L'approche propos\'ee se d\'ecompose en trois \'etapes : (1) la recherche de similarit\'e entre concepts en se basant sur des techniques syntaxiques, structurelles et s\'emantiques ; (2) la fusion d'ontologies par l'approche alg\'ebrique SPO ; (3) l'adaptation de l'ontologie globale r\'esultante par le biais des r\`egles de r\'e\'ecriture de graphes.Afin de valider les travaux men\'es dans cette th\`ese, nous avons d\'evelopp\'e plusieurs outils open source bas\'es sur l'outil AGG (Attributed Graph Grammar). Ces outils ont \'et\'e appliqu\'es sur un ensemble d'ontologies, essentiellement sur celles d\'evelopp\'ees dans le cadre du projet europ\'een CCAlps (Creatives Companies in Alpine Space) qui a financ\'e les travaux de cette th\`ese.},

Numerous propositions to address these problems of data integration have been made, either based on ontologies or on additional metadata. However ontologies suffer from a adaptation speed slower than the data evolution speed and metadata requires ad-hoc manipulations of data by addition of extra-data. In this article we propose an original approach, based exclusively on data from the base, to evaluate the consistency of a candidate update to a RDF base, and finally to know if this update is relevant to the base. Our approach is inspired by case-based reasoning and uses similarity evaluation and query relaxation methods to compare a candidate update to the data from the base. If the modifications of a candidate update make the target part of the base more similar to other part (s) of the base, then this candidate update is considered consistent with the base and can be applied.},

  abstract = {Real world data offers a lot of possibilities to be represented as graphs. As a result we obtain undirected or directed graphs, multigraphs and hypergraphs, labelled or weighted graphs and their variants. A development of graph modelling brings also new approaches, e.g., considering constraints. Processing graphs in a database way can be done in many different ways. Some graphs can be represented as JSON or XML structures and processed by their native database tools. More generally, a graph database is specified as any storage system that provides index-free adjacency, i.e. an explicit graph structure. Graph database technology contains some technological features inherent to traditional databases, e.g. ACID properties and availability. Use cases of graph databases like Neo4j, OrientDB, InfiniteGraph, FlockDB, AllegroGraph, and others, document that graph databases are becoming a common means for any connected data. In Big Data era, important questions are connected with scalability for large graphs as well as scaling for read/write operations. For example, scaling graph data by distributing it in a network is much more difficult than scaling simpler data models and is still a work in progress. Still a challenge is pattern matching in graphs providing, in principle, an arbitrarily complex identity function. Mining complete frequent patterns from graph databases is also challenging since supporting operations are computationally costly. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and limitations in these areas as well as future directions.},

  abstract = {A sound and, in certain cases, complete method is described for evaluating queries in relational databases with null values where these nulls represent existing but unknown individuals. The soundness and completeness results are proved relative to a formalization of such databases as suitable theories of first-order logic. Because the algorithm conforms to the relational algebra, it may easily be incorporated into existing relational systems.},

  abstract = {Suppose one wishes to construct, use, and maintain a database of facts about the real world, even though the state of that world is only partially known. In the artificial intelligence domain, this problem arises when an agent has a base set of beliefs that reflect partial knowledge about the world, and then tries to incorporate new, possibly contradictory knowledge into this set of beliefs. In the database domain, one facet of this situation is the well-known null values problem. We choose to represent such a database as a logical theory, and view the models of the theory as representing possible states of the world that are consistent with all known information. How can new information be incorporated into the database? For example, given the new information that ``b or c is true,'' how can one get rid of all outdated information about b and c, add the new information, and yet in the process not disturb any other information in the database? In current-day database management systems, the difficult and tedious burden of determining exactly what to add and remove from the database is placed on the user. The goal of our research was to relieve users of that burden, by equipping the database management system with update algorithms that can automatically determine what to add and remove from the database. Under our approach, new information about the state of the world is input to the database management system as a well-formed formula that the state of the world is now known to satisfy. We have constructed database update algorithms to interpret this update formula and incorporate the new information represented by the formula into the database without further assistance from the user. In this paper we show how to embed the incomplete database and the incoming information in the language of mathematical logic, explain the semantics of our update operators, and discuss the algorithms that implement these operators.},
