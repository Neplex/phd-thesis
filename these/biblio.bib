This paper discusses the difficulty of optimizing queries based on the relational algebra operations select, project, and join. A matrix, called a tableau, is proposed as a useful device for representing the value of a query, and optimization of queries is couched in terms of finding a minimal tableau equivalent to a given one. Functional dependencies can be used to imply additional equivalences among tableaux. Although the optimization problem is NP-complete, a polynomial time algorithm exists to optimize tableaux that correspond to an important subclass of queries.},

Many open-access datasets are RDF graphs, but others are CSV files, Neo4J property graphs, JSON or XML documents, etc. Potential users need to understand a dataset in order to decide if it is useful for their goal. While some datasets come with a schema and/or documentation, this is not always the case. Data summarization or schema inference tools have been proposed, specializing in XML, or JSON, or the RDF data models. In this work, we present a dataset abstraction approach, which () applies on relational, CSV, XML, JSON, RDF or Property Graph data; () computes an abstraction meant for humans (as opposed to a schema meant for a parser); () integrates Information Extraction data profiling, to also classify dataset content among a set of categories of interest to the user. Our abstractions are conceptually close to an Entity-Relationship diagram, if one allows nested and possibly heterogeneous structure within entities.},

We aim especially to give a coherent and in-depth perspective on current graph querying and an outlook for future developments.

Consistent answers to queries wrt a set of ICs have been characterized as answers that can be obtained from every possible minimally repaired consistent version of the original database. In this paper we consider databases that contain null values and are also repaired, if necessary, using null values. For this purpose, we propose first a precise semantics for IC satisfaction in a database with null values that is compatible with the way null values are treated in commercial database management systems. Next, a precise notion of repair is introduced that privileges the introduction of null values when repairing foreign key constraints, in such a way that these new values do not create an infinite cycle of new inconsistencies. Finally, we analyze how to specify this kind of repairs of a database that contains null values using disjunctive logic programs with stable model semantics.},

Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of Web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the Web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and Web proliferation, creating a Web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale Web search engine \textemdash{} the first such detailed public description we know of to date. Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.},

We show that within this framework, one can prove a theorem analogous to one of Kleinberg (2002), in which one obtains an existence and uniqueness theorem instead of a non-existence result. We explore further properties of this unique scheme: stability and convergence are established. We represent dendrograms as ultrametric spaces and use tools from metric geometry, namely the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, to quantify the degree to which perturbations in the input metric space affect the result of hierarchical methods.

This problem comes back to light in real-world linked data or RDF databases when blank nodes are associated with null values. This paper proposes solutions for the main problems one has to face when dealing with updates and constraints, namely update determinism, minimal change and leanness of an RDF graph instance. The update semantics is formally introduced and the notion of core is used to ensure a database as small as possible (i.e.~~ the RDF graph leanness). Our algorithms allow the use of constraints such as tuple-generating dependencies, offering a way for solving many practical problems.},

In prior work, we tackled the generic problem of database updating in the presence of tuple generating constraints from a theoretical viewpoint. The current paper considers the usability of our approach by (a) introducing incremental update routines (instead of the previous from-scratch versions) and (b) removing the restriction that limits the contents of the database to fit in the main memory. In doing so, this paper offers new algorithms, proposes queries and data models inviting discussions on the representation of incompleteness on databases. We also propose implementations under a graph database model and the traditional relational database model. Our experiments show that computation times are similar globally but point to discrepancies in some steps.},

We propose 19 rules modelling atomic updates and prove that their application necessarily preserves the database's consistency. If an update has to be applied when the application conditions of the corre- sponding rule do not hold, side-effects are generated: they engender new updates in order to ensure the rule applicability.

We re-examine the notion of certainty itself, and show that it is much more varied than previously thought. We identify cases when certain answers can be computed efficiently and, short of that, provide deterministic and probabilistic approximation schemes for them. We look at the role of three-valued logic as used in SQL query evaluation, and discuss the correctness of the choice, as well as the necessity of such a logic for producing query answers.},

Data integration as well as the Semantic Web are notable examples. Surprisingly, while many research efforts have been focusing on several interesting issues related to incomplete databases, as query answering, not much investigation have been done concerning updates. In this position paper we aim at highlighting some of the issues we are dealing with in our work on updates over incomplete databases. Instance level updates under constraints Our interest in this area stems mainly from the need to deal with updates in Description Logics based ontologies. Description logics (DLs) are logics for expressing the conceptual knowledge about a domain in terms of classes and associations between them [1]. Such logics are currently considered among the most promising formalisms for representing ontologies by the Semantic Web community [2]. DL-based ontologies are often used for accessing data stored in a data layer by means of query answering.},

  abstract = {Data exchange is the problem of taking data structured under a source schema and creating an instance of a target schema that reflects the source data as accurately as possible. Given a source instance, there may be many solutions to the data exchange problem, that is, many target instances that satisfy the constraints of the data exchange problem. In an earlier article, we identified a special class of solutions that we call universal. A universal solution has homomorphisms into every possible solution, and hence is a ``most general possible'' solution. Nonetheless, given a source instance, there may be many universal solutions. This naturally raises the question of whether there is a ``best'' universal solution, and hence a best solution for data exchange. We answer this question by considering the well-known notion of the core of a structure, a notion that was first studied in graph theory, and has also played a role in conjunctive-query processing. The core of a structure is the smallest substructure that is also a homomorphic image of the structure. All universal solutions have the same core (up to isomorphism); we show that this core is also a universal solution, and hence the smallest universal solution. The uniqueness of the core of a universal solution together with its minimality make the core an ideal solution for data exchange. We investigate the computational complexity of producing the core. Well-known results by Chandra and Merlin imply that, unless P = NP, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that, given a structure as input, returns the core of that structure as output. In contrast, in the context of data exchange, we identify natural and fairly broad conditions under which there are polynomial-time algorithms for computing the core of a universal solution. We also analyze the computational complexity of the following decision problem that underlies the computation of cores: given two graphs G and H, is H the core of G? Earlier results imply that this problem is both NP-hard and coNP-hard. Here, we pinpoint its exact complexity by establishing that it is a DP-complete problem. Finally, we show that the core is the best among all universal solutions for answering existential queries, and we propose an alternative semantics for answering queries in data exchange settings.},

The methodology is also adapted to updating databases, where different facts can carry different priorities, and to updating user views.},

A GED is defined as a combination of a graph pattern and an attribute dependency. In a uniform format, GEDs can express graph functional dependencies with constant literals to catch inconsistencies, and keys carrying id literals to identify entities (vertices) in a graph. We revise the chase for GEDs and prove its Church-Rosser property. We characterize GED satisfiability and implication, and establish the complexity of these problems and the validation problem for GEDs, in the presence and absence of constant literals and id literals. We also develop a sound, complete and independent axiom system for finite implication of GEDs. In addition, we extend GEDs with built-in predicates or disjunctions, to strike a balance between the expressive power and complexity. We settle the complexity of the satisfiability, implication, and validation problems for these extensions.},

We propose a class of keys that are recursively defined in terms of graph patterns, and are interpreted with subgraph isomorphism.

As an application, we study the entity matching problem that, given a graph G and a set {$\Sigma$} of keys, is to find all pairs of entities (vertices) in G that are identified by keys in {$\Sigma$}. We show that the problem is intractable, and cannot be parallelized in logarithmic rounds. Nonetheless, we provide two parallel scalable algorithms for entity matching, in MapReduce and a vertex-centric asynchronous model. Using real-life and synthetic data, we experimentally verify the effectiveness and scalability of the algorithms.},

However, answering SPARQL queries requires handling RDF reasoning, which must be implemented outside the relational engines that do not support it. We introduce the database (DB) fragment of RDF, going beyond the expressive power of previously studied RDF fragments. We devise novel sound and complete techniques for answering Basic Graph Pattern (BGP) queries within the DB fragment of RDF, exploring the two established approaches for handling RDF semantics, namely reformulation and saturation. In particular, we focus on handling database updates within each approach and propose a method for incrementally maintaining the saturation; updates raise specific difficulties due to the rich RDF semantics. Our techniques are designed to be deployed on top of any RDBMS(-style) engine, and we experimentally study their performance trade-offs.},

We use the technique of hypertree decompositions to derive improved algorithms for computing the core of a relational instance with labeled nulls, a problem we show to be fixed-parameter intractable with respect to the block size of the input instances. We show that computing the core of a data exchange problem is tractable for two large and useful classes of target constraints. The first class includes functional dependencies and weakly acyclic inclusion dependencies. The second class consists of full tuple generating dependencies and arbitrary equation generating dependencies. Finally, we show that computing cores is NP-hard in presence of a system-predicate NULL(x), which is true iff x is a null value.},

Yet few existing database management systems allow the user to enter null values in the database. This monograph analyses the problems raised by allowing null values in relational databases. The analysis covers semantical, syntactical, and computational aspects. Algorithms for query evaluation, dependency enforcement and updates in the presence of null values are also given. The analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithms suggests that from a practical point of view the database should be stored as Horn tables, which are generalizations of ordinary relations, allowing null values and Horn clause-like restrictions on these null values. Horn tables efficiently support a large class of queries, dependencies and updates.},

Having efficiency as its main goal, SQL disregards the standard notion of correctness on incomplete databases -- certain answers -- due to its high complexity. As a result, the evaluation of SQL queries on databases with nulls may produce answers that are just plain wrong. However, SQL evaluation can be modified, at least for relational algebra queries, to approximate certain answers, i.e., return only correct answers. We examine recently proposed approximation schemes for certain answers and analyze their complexity, both theoretical bounds and real-life behavior},

A basic feature of our approach is that new knowledge inputs are always assimilated. Moreover, updates are always deterministic and they preserve database consistency.We consider that update rules have higher priority than query rules, i.e., update rules may generate exceptions to query-driven derivations. We introduce a semantics framework for database update and query answering, based on the well-founded semantics. We also suggest an alternative approach based on extended logic programs and we show that our database model can be defined in terms of non-monotonic formalisms.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1970s there has been vigorous activity in constructing highly constrained grammatical systems by eliminating the transformational component either totally or partially. There is increasing recognition of the fact that the entire range of dependencies that transformational grammars in their various incarnations have tried to account for can be captured satisfactorily by classes of rules that are nontransformational and at the same time highly constrained in terms of the classes of grammars and languages they define.Two types of dependencies are especially important: subcategorization and filler-gap dependencies. Moreover, these dependencies can be unbounded. One of the motivations for transformations was to account for unbounded dependencies. The so-called nontransformational grammars account for the unbounded dependencies in different ways. In a tree adjoining grammar (TAG) unboundedness is achieved by factoring the dependencies and recursion in a novel and linguistically interesting manner. All dependencies are defined on a finite set of basic structures (trees), which are bounded. Unboundedness is then a corollary of a particular composition operation called adjoining. There are thus no unbounded dependencies in a sense.This factoring of recursion and dependencies is in contrast to transformational grammars (TG), where recursion is defined in the base and the transformations essentially carry out the checking of the dependencies. The phrase linking grammars (PLGs) (Peters and Ritchie, 1982) and the lexical functional grammars (LFGs) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1983) share this aspect of TGs; that is, recursion builds up a set a structures, some of which are then filtered out by transformations in a TG, by the constraints on linking in a PLG, and by the constraints introduced via the functional structures in an LFG.},

An algorithm is given which detects when such semantic rules could possibly lead to circular definition of some attributes. An example is given of a simple programming language defined with both inherited and synthesized attributes, and the method of definition is compared to other techniques for formal specification of semantics which have appeared in the literature.},

  abstract = {Incomplete data is ubiquitous: the more data we accumulate and the more widespread tools for integrating and exchanging data become, the more instances of incompleteness we have. And yet the subject is poorly handled by both practice and theory. Many queries for which students get full marks in their undergraduate courses will not work correctly in the presence of incomplete data, but these ways of evaluating queries are cast in stone -- SQL standard. We have many theoretical results on handling incomplete data but they are, by and large, about showing high complexity bounds, and thus are often dismissed by practitioners. Even worse, we have a basic theoretical notion of what it means to answer queries over incomplete data, and yet this is not at all what practical systems do. Is there a way out of this predicament? Can we have a theory of incompleteness that will appeal to theoreticians and practitioners alike, by explaining incompleteness and being at the same time implementable and useful for applications? After giving a critique of both the practice and the theory of handling incompleteness in databases, the paper outlines a possible way out of this crisis. The key idea is to combine three hitherto used approaches to incompleteness: one based on certain answers and representation systems, one based on viewing incomplete databases as logical theories, and one based on orderings expressing relative value of information.},

Theoretical research has long ago identified the notion of correctness of query answering over incomplete data: one needs to find certain answers, which are true regardless of how incomplete information is interpreted. This serves as the notion of correctness of query answering, but carries a huge complexity tag. In practice, on the other hand, query answering must be very efficient, and to achieve this, SQL uses three-valued logic for evaluating queries on databases with nulls. Due to the complexity mismatch, the two approaches cannot coincide, but perhaps they are related in some way. For instance, does SQL always produce answers we can be certain about? This is not so: SQL's and certain answers semantics could be totally unrelated. We show, however, that a slight modification of the three-valued semantics for relational calculus queries can provide the required certainty guarantees. The key point of the new scheme is to fully utilize the three-valued semantics, and classify answers not into certain or noncertain, as was done before, but rather into certainly true, certainly false, or unknown. This yields relatively small changes to the evaluation procedure, which we consider at the level of both declarative (relational calculus) and procedural (relational algebra) queries. These new evaluation procedures give us certainty guarantees even for queries returning tuples with null values.},

  abstract = {Consistency Enforcement provides an alternative theory to common verification techniques within formal specification languages. We consider specifications in the form of guarded commands. The basic idea is then to replace a program specification S by its greatest consistent specialization (GCS) SI which is provably consistent with respect to a given static constraint I, preserves the effects of S according to a specialization order and is maximal with these properties. The theory has been shown to provide several strengths. In particular, the enforcement process for a huge class of complex specifications can be reduced to its basic components. Moreover, the result can be obtained sequentially and is independent from the order of the given constraints. In addition, arithmetic logic has been used to show that GCSs can be efficiently computed for a reasonably large class of program specifications and invariants. However, all results have been achieved with respect to the underlying specialization order. The simplicity of this order reveals some obvious weaknesses. In this paper, we show how the specialization order can be replaced by the notion of {$\delta$}-constraints. Specialization of a program specification S turns out to be equivalent to the preservation of all {$\delta$}-constraints on the underlying state space of S. Obviously, this enables us to weaken the specialization order towards the preservation of certain {$\delta$}-constraints. We define maximal consistent effect preservers (MCEs), show that these are closely related to GCSs and prove that MCEs can be obtained sequentially and independently from the order of a given set of static constraints. This backs up the conjecture that the notion of MCEs leads towards a tailored theory of consistency enforcement.},

For the first case, the similarity increases as the difference between the two involved feature values decreases. Furthermore, the contribution of the difference is normally scaled. For the second case, a fixed value is contributed to the similarity. For the last case, the feature has no contribution to the similarity. The proposed measure is extended to gauge the similarity between two sets of documents. The effectiveness of our measure is evaluated on several real-world data sets for text classification and clustering problems. The results show that the performance obtained by the proposed measure is better than that achieved by other measures.},

Leur r\'eutilisation peut prendre diff\'erentes formes (\'evolution, alignement, fusion, etc.), et pr\'esente plusieurs verrous scientifiques. L'un des plus importants est la pr\'eservation de la consistance de l'ontologie lors de son changement. Afin d'y r\'epondre, nous nous int\'eressons dans cette th\`ese \`a \'etudier les changements ontologiques et proposons un cadre formel capable de faire \'evoluer et de fusionner des ontologies sans affecter leur consistance. Premi\`erement, nous proposons TGGOnto (Typed Graph Grammars for Ontologies), un nouveau formalisme permettant la repr\'esentation des ontologies et leurs changements par les grammaires de graphes typ\'es. Un couplage entre ces deux formalismes est d\'efini afin de profiter des concepts des grammaires de graphes, notamment les NAC (Negative Application Conditions), pour la pr\'eservation de la consistance de l'ontologie adapt\'ee.Deuxi\`emement, nous proposons EvOGG (Evolving Ontologies with Graph Grammars), une approche d'\'evolution d'ontologies qui se base sur le formalisme GGTOnto et traite les inconsistances d'une mani\`ere a priori. Nous nous int\'eressons aux ontologies OWL et nous traitons \`a la fois : (1) l'enrichissement d'ontologies en \'etudiant leur niveau structurel et (2) le peuplement d'ontologies en \'etudiant les changements qui affectent les individus et leurs assertions. L'approche EvOGG d\'efinit des changements ontologiques de diff\'erents types (\'el\'ementaires, compos\'ees et complexes) et assure leur impl\'ementation par l'approche alg\'ebrique de transformation de graphes, SPO (Simple PushOut). Troisi\`emement, nous proposons GROM (Graph Rewriting for Ontology Merging), une approche de fusion d'ontologies capable d'\'eviter les redondances de donn\'ees et de diminuer les conflits dans le r\'esultat de fusion. L'approche propos\'ee se d\'ecompose en trois \'etapes : (1) la recherche de similarit\'e entre concepts en se basant sur des techniques syntaxiques, structurelles et s\'emantiques ; (2) la fusion d'ontologies par l'approche alg\'ebrique SPO ; (3) l'adaptation de l'ontologie globale r\'esultante par le biais des r\`egles de r\'e\'ecriture de graphes.Afin de valider les travaux men\'es dans cette th\`ese, nous avons d\'evelopp\'e plusieurs outils open source bas\'es sur l'outil AGG (Attributed Graph Grammar).

Numerous propositions to address these problems of data integration have been made, either based on ontologies or on additional metadata. However ontologies suffer from a adaptation speed slower than the data evolution speed and metadata requires ad-hoc manipulations of data by addition of extra-data. In this article we propose an original approach, based exclusively on data from the base, to evaluate the consistency of a candidate update to a RDF base, and finally to know if this update is relevant to the base. Our approach is inspired by case-based reasoning and uses similarity evaluation and query relaxation methods to compare a candidate update to the data from the base. If the modifications of a candidate update make the target part of the base more similar to other part (s) of the base, then this candidate update is considered consistent with the base and can be applied.},

The system consists of two memory-based engines, one that decides if the tokens in a sentence are negation signals, and another that finds the full scope of these negation signals. Our approach to negation detection differs in two main aspects from existing research on negation. First, we focus on finding the scope of negation signals, instead of determining whether a term is negated or not. Second, we apply supervised machine learning techniques, whereas most existing systems apply rule-based algorithms. As far as we know, this way of approaching the negation scope finding task is novel.},

  abstract = {Incomplete information has been studied in-depth in relational databases and knowledge representation. In the context of the Web, incomplete information issues have been studied in detail for XML, but very few papers exist that do the same for RDF. In this paper we make the first general proposal for extending RDF with the ability to represent property values that exist but are unknown or partially known using constraints. Following ideas from incomplete information literature, we develop a semantics for this extension of RDF, called RDFi, and study query evaluation for SPARQL. We transfer the concept of representation systems from incomplete information in relational databases to the case of RDFi and identify two very important fragments of SPARQL that can be used to define a representation system for RDFi. The first corresponds to the monotone fragment of graph patterns that uses only the operators AND, UNION, and FILTER. The second corresponds to the well-designed graph patterns, that is, a fragment that uses only operators AND, FILTER, and OPT, and enjoys interesting properties that make query evaluation efficient. We prove that each of the two fragments can be used to define a representation system for CONSTRUCT queries without blank nodes in their templates. We also define the fundamental concept of certain answers to SPARQL queries over RDFi databases and present an algorithm for its computation. Then, we present complexity results for computing certain answers by considering equality, temporal, and spatial constraint languages and the class of CONSTRUCT queries of our representation systems. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of RDFi in geospatial Semantic Web applications by giving a number of examples and comparing the modeling capabilities of RDFi with related formalisms found in the literature.},

In this work we concentrate on tuple generating dependencies (tgds) which enforce the presence of certain tuples in a database instance if certain other tuples are already present. Previous complexity results in data integration and data exchange mainly referred to the data complexity. In this work, we study the query complexity and combined complexity of a fundamental problem related to tgds, namely checking if a given tgd is satisfied by a database instance. We also address an important variant of this problem which deals with updates (by inserts or deletes) of a database: Here we have to check if all previously satisfied tgds are still satisfied after an update. We show that the query complexity and combined complexity of these problems are much higher than the data complexity. However, we also prove sufficient conditions on the tgds to reduce this high complexity.},

  abstract = {Real world data offers a lot of possibilities to be represented as graphs. As a result we obtain undirected or directed graphs, multigraphs and hypergraphs, labelled or weighted graphs and their variants. A development of graph modelling brings also new approaches, e.g., considering constraints. Processing graphs in a database way can be done in many different ways. Some graphs can be represented as JSON or XML structures and processed by their native database tools. More generally, a graph database is specified as any storage system that provides index-free adjacency, i.e. an explicit graph structure. Graph database technology contains some technological features inherent to traditional databases, e.g. ACID properties and availability. Use cases of graph databases like Neo4j, OrientDB, InfiniteGraph, FlockDB, AllegroGraph, and others, document that graph databases are becoming a common means for any connected data. In Big Data era, important questions are connected with scalability for large graphs as well as scaling for read/write operations. For example, scaling graph data by distributing it in a network is much more difficult than scaling simpler data models and is still a work in progress. Still a challenge is pattern matching in graphs providing, in principle, an arbitrarily complex identity function. Mining complete frequent patterns from graph databases is also challenging since supporting operations are computationally costly. In this paper, we discuss recent advances and limitations in these areas as well as future directions.},

It is this model theoretic paradigm which leads, for example, to many valued propositional logies for databases with null values. In this chapter I argue that a proof theoretic view of databases is possible, and indeed much more fruitful. Specifically, I show how relational databases can be seen as special theories of first order logic, namely theories incorporating the following assumptions:1.The domain closure assumption. The individuals occurring in the database are all and only the existing individuals.2.The unique name assumption. Individuals with distinct names are distinct.3.The closed world assumption. The only possible instances of a relation are those implied by the database. It will follow that a proof theoretic paradigm for relational databases provides a correct treatment of:1.Query evaluation for databases that have incomplete information, including null values.2.Integrity constraints and their enforcement.3.Conceptual modelling and the extension of the relational model to incorporate more real world semantics.},

  abstract = {Integrity Maintenance is considered one of the major application fields of rule triggering systems (RTSs). In the case of a given integrity constraint being violated by a database transition these systems trigger repairing actions. Then it is necessary to guarantee the termination of the RTS, its determinacy and the consistency of final states. Transition specifications provide some kind of dynamic semantics requiring certasin effects on database states to occur. In the context of transition specifications integrity maintenance has to cope with the additional problem of effect preservation. Limitations of RTSs with respect to this extended problems are investigated. It will be shown that for any set of constraints there exist non-repairable transitions, which depend on the closure of the constraint set. This implies that integrity maintenance by RTSs is only possible, if the constraint implication problem is decidable. Even if unrepairable transitions are excluded, this does not prevent the RTS to produce undesired behaviour. Analyzing the behaviour of RTSs leads to the definition of critical paths in associated rule hypergraphs and the requirement of such paths being absent. It will be shown that this requirement can be satisfied if the underlying set of constraints is stratified, but this notion turns out to be too strong to be also necessary. A sufficient and necessary condition for the absence of critical paths is obtained, if sets of constraints are required to be locally stratified.},

  abstract = {State oriented specifications with invariants occur in almost all formal specification languages. Hence the problem is to prove the consistency of the specified operations with respect to the invariants. Whilst the problem seems to be easily solvable in predicative specifications, it usually requires sophisticated verification efforts, when specifications in the style of Dijkstra's guarded commands as e.g. in the specification language B are used. As an alternative consistency enforcement will be discussed in this paper. The basic idea is to replace inconsistent operations by new consistent ones preserving at the same time the intention of the old one. More precisely, this can be formalized by consistent spezializations, where specialization is a specific partial order on operations defined via predicate transformers. It will be shown that greatest consistent specializations (GCSs) always exist and are compatible with conjunctions of invariants. Then under certain mild restrictions the general construction of such GCSs is possible. Precisely, given the GCSs of simple basic assignments the GCS of a complex operation results from replacing involved assignments by their GCSs and the investigation of a guard. In general, GCS construction can be embedded in refinement calculi and therefore strengthens the systematic development of correct programs.},

In particular this thesis concentrates on our contributions to the study of incomplete information in the context of data interoperability. In this scenario data is heterogenous and decentralized, needs to be integrated from several sources and exchanged between different applications. Incompleteness, i.e. the presence of ``missing'' or ``unknown'' portions of data, is naturally generated in data exchange and integration, due to data heterogeneity. The management of incomplete information poses new challenges in this context.The focus of our study is the development of models of incomplete information suitable to data interoperability tasks, and the study of techniques for efficiently querying several forms of incompleteness.},

  abstract = {Normalization aims at minimizing sources of potential data inconsistency and costs of update maintenance incurred by data redundancy. For relational databases, different classes of dependencies cause data redundancy and have resulted in proposals such as Third, Boyce-Codd, Fourth and Fifth Normal Form. Features of more advanced data models make it challenging to extend achievements from the relational model to missing, non-atomic, or uncertain data. We initiate research on the normalization of graph data, starting with a class of functional dependencies tailored to property graphs. We show that this class captures important semantics of applications, constitutes a rich source of data redundancy, its implication problem can be decided in linear time, and facilitates the normalization of property graphs flexibly tailored to their labels and properties that are targeted by applications. We normalize property graphs into Boyce-Codd Normal Form without loss of data and dependencies whenever possible for the target labels and properties, but guarantee Third Normal Form in general. Experiments on real-world property graphs quantify and qualify various benefits of graph normalization: 1) removing redundant property values as sources of inconsistent data, 2) detecting inconsistency as violation of functional dependencies, 3) reducing update overheads by orders of magnitude, and 4) significant speed ups of aggregate queries.},

It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms.

These models have obtained notable gains in accuracy across many NLP tasks.

As a result these models are costly to train and develop, both financially, due to the cost of hardware and electricity or cloud compute time, and environmentally, due to the carbon footprint required to fuel modern tensor processing hardware. In this paper we bring this issue to the attention of NLP researchers by quantifying the approximate financial and environmental costs of training a variety of recently successful neural network models for NLP. Based on these findings, we propose actionable recommendations to reduce costs and improve equity in NLP research and practice.},

  abstract = {The algebraic definitions presented here are motivated by our search for an adequate formalization of the concepts of social roles as regularities in social network patterns. The theorems represent significant homomorphic reductions of social networks which are possible using these definitions to capture the role structure of a network. The concepts build directly on the pioneering work of S.F. Nadel (1957) and the pathbreaking approach to blockmodeling introduced by Lorrain and White (1971) and refined in subsequent years (White, Boorman and Breiger 1976;Boorman and White 1976; Arabie, Boorman and Levitt, 1978; Sailer, 1978). Blockmodeling is one of the predominant techniques for deriving structural models of social networks. When a network is represented by a directed multigraph, a blockmodel of the multigraph can be characterized as mapping points and edges onto their images in a reduced multigraph. The relations in a network or multigraph can also be composed to form a semigroup. In the first part of the paper we examine ``graph'' homomorphisms, or homomorphic mappings of the points or actors in a network. A family of basic concepts of role equivalence are introduced, and theorems presented to show the structure preserving properties of their various induced homomorphisms. This extends the ``classic'' approach to blockmodeling via the equivalence of positions. Lorrain and White (1971), Pattison (1980), Boyd, 1980, Boyd, 1982, and most recently Bonacich (1982) have explored the topic taken up in the second part of this paper, namely the homomorphic reduction of the semigroup of relations on a network, and the relation between semigroup and graph homomorphisms. Our approach allows us a significant beginning in reducing the complexity of a multigraph by collapsing relations which play a similar ``role'' in the network.},

  abstract = {Suppose one wishes to construct, use, and maintain a database of facts about the real world, even though the state of that world is only partially known. In the artificial intelligence domain, this problem arises when an agent has a base set of beliefs that reflect partial knowledge about the world, and then tries to incorporate new, possibly contradictory knowledge into this set of beliefs. In the database domain, one facet of this situation is the well-known null values problem. We choose to represent such a database as a logical theory, and view the models of the theory as representing possible states of the world that are consistent with all known information. How can new information be incorporated into the database? For example, given the new information that ``b or c is true,'' how can one get rid of all outdated information about b and c, add the new information, and yet in the process not disturb any other information in the database? In current-day database management systems, the difficult and tedious burden of determining exactly what to add and remove from the database is placed on the user. The goal of our research was to relieve users of that burden, by equipping the database management system with update algorithms that can automatically determine what to add and remove from the database. Under our approach, new information about the state of the world is input to the database management system as a well-formed formula that the state of the world is now known to satisfy. We have constructed database update algorithms to interpret this update formula and incorporate the new information represented by the formula into the database without further assistance from the user. In this paper we show how to embed the incomplete database and the incoming information in the language of mathematical logic, explain the semantics of our update operators, and discuss the algorithms that implement these operators.},

The basis of our approach is an interpretation of nulls which obviates the need for more than one type of null. The conceptual soundness of this approach is demonstrated by generalizing the formal framework of the relational data model to include null values. In particular, the set-theoretical properties of relations with nulls are studied and the definitions of set inclusion, set union, and set difference are generalized. A simple and efficient strategy for evaluating queries in the presence of nulls is provided. The operators of relational algebra are then generalized accordingly. Finally, the deep-rooted logical and computational problems of previous approaches are reviewed to emphasize the superior practicability of the solution.},

  abstract = {Frequency counts of phonemes, morphemes, and words in samples of written discourse in diverse languages are presented in support of the generalization that the more complex any speech element, the less frequently does it occur. Thus, the greater the frequency of occurrence of words, the less tends to be their average length, and the smaller also is the number of different words. The relation between frequency and number of different words is said to be expressed by the formula ab2 = k, in which a represents the number of different words of a given frequency and b the frequency. The relationship between the magnitude of speech elements and their frequency is attributed to the operation of a "law" of linguistic change: that as the frequency of phonemes or of linguistic forms increases, their magnitude decreases. There is thus a tendency to "maintain an equilibrium" between length and frequency, and this tendency rests upon an "underlying law of economy." Human beings strive to maintain an "emotional equilibrium" between variety and repetitiveness of environmental factors and behavior. A speaker's discourse must represent a compromise between variety and repetitiveness adapted to the hearer's "tolerable limits of change in maintaining emotional equilibrium." This accounts for the maintenance of the relationship ab2 = k; the exponent of b expresses this "rate of variegation." (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},
